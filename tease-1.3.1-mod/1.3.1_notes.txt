TEASE 1.3.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEASE is a text editor specially tailored for those who use scripting and/or cross O/S's frequently in their daily tasks.  Topping its feature list are fast comments from the context menu, an excellent search and replace interface, and scripting aids like tail-f and one-click running.  New on its feature list with this release are bookmarks and configurable menu commands.

This is release 1.3.1 of TEASE, currently governed by the terms of the GNU General Public License (see license.txt included in this distribution, or http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).

This is a beta release, consisting largely of new functionality, with a few small bug fixes.  Expect some bugs and problems, and please submit them at http://tease.sourceforge.net or send to chessh@users.sourceforge.net when you do encounter them.  The more specific you can be (and if you can include a stack trace output when it comes up), the better.  Thank you.

Credits
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tease uses Pat Thoyts's excellent winsend extension which utilizes the windows COM API.  Winsend is available at http://tclsoap.sourceforge.net/winsend.html .

Printing on windows is courtesy of Iain Findleton's text widget printing routines in his tkPrint package, downloadable from http://pages.videotron.com/cclients/ .

The tease windows executable is built with Dennis LaBelle's freewrap utility, a tool I highly recommend.  Find it at http://freewrap.sourceforge.net/ .



Issues
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. LOADING FILES ON WINDOWS
Using winsend has eliminated the "DDE server not responding" errors on win2k and XP.  However, at certain times, loading a significantly large number of files at once (the "magic number" in my testing appears to be around 12-15) using an action configured for the filetype (ie, "open" action for the ".txt" file extension configured to tease) results in unusual errors such as widget pathnames not found or variable does not exist.  Opening ten or less files at once does not seem to trigger these errors.  Using tease in the "send to" menu does not seem to trigger these errors even when opening over twenty files at the same time.  Opening the files one or two at a time into an existing "single" mode window does not seem to trigger these errors no matter how many files are open already.

2. ERRORS
When any program error during shutdown occurs, the "listener" portion of the program may not shut down properly.  Look for tease.exe or wish84.exe in the task manager to kill it completely.

3. NO DOCUMENT LOCK
No windows file locks are utilized in tease.  It is possible to open files in another text editor when they are already open in tease.

4. UNIX SEND
Send on unix is proving to be difficult to test, and as such has not yet been scheduled for implementation.
